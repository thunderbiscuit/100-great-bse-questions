# How do virtual size, stripped size and raw size compare between legacy address formats and native segwit?  

[This answer](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/67113/how-does-segwit-reduce-transaction-size-when-the-signature-is-simply-moved-to-a/67115#67115) states that SegWit doesn't reduce transaction size. If this is true, why is it cheaper to send a SegWit transaction?

Let's compare a 2-input and 2-output transaction for single-sig output types. I'll refer to the byte length of the transaction as "raw size" , the transaction without its witness data as "stripped size", and the size-equivalent when accounting for the witness discount as "virtual size".

Table showing the detailed data

- **P2PKH** – _Pay to Public Key Hash_ has no witness data, so raw size is equal to stripped size is equal to virtual size. A P2PKH transaction with two inputs and two outputs has 374 bytes (= 374 vbytes).

- **P2SH-P2WPKH** – _Pay to Script Hash-wrapped Pay to Witness Public Key Hash_ (aka "wrapped segwit") locks funds to a P2SH output, but the input's redeemscript contains a witness program that redirects the evaluation to the witness stack. The content of the witness stack is the same as a P2PKH `scriptSig`. A P2SH-P2WPKH transaction with two inputs and two outputs has a raw size of 420 bytes, a stripped size (removing witness data) of 202 bytes, and a virtual size of 256.5 vbytes.

- **P2WPKH** – _Pay to Witness Public Key Hash_ (aka single-sig v0 native segwit) does not need the P2SH indirection, but directly resolves a witness program. It has the same witness stack as a P2SH-P2WPKH input. A P2WPKH transaction with two inputs and two outputs has a raw size of 372 bytes, a stripped size of 154 bytes and a virtual size of 208.5 vbytes.

- **P2TR** – _Pay to Taproot_ (v1 native segwit (keypath-spend)) also directly resolves a witness program. Since the witness program already contains a public key instead of a pubkey hash, the witness stack is smaller by the public key, but the output script is larger. A P2TR transaction with two inputs and two outputs has a raw size of 312 bytes, a stripped size of 178 bytes, and a virtual size of 211.5 vbytes.

The **raw size** corresponds to the **data footprint** of the transaction on disk or the bandwidth cost to transmit it. We see that P2SH-P2WPKH is actually the biggest in raw size by a margin. P2WPKH and P2PKH are very close to each other in raw size with the legacy format P2PKH being slightly smaller in input size, but slightly bigger in output size. P2TR has the smallest data footprint.

The **virtual size** corresponds to the **blockweight** which determines the fees and how many transactions can fit in a block. After applying the weighing that the witness is subject to, P2WPKH has the smallest weight, closely followed by P2TR, followed by P2SH-P2WPKH and the legacy format P2PKH counts as the heaviest.

### Size calculations

Transaction **headers** list the transaction version (4 B), the count of inputs (VarInt, usually 1 B, but up to 9 B), the count of outputs (varInt, usually 1 B, but up to 9 B), and the locktime (4 B). For segwit transactions, we add a witness marker (1 WU) and a witness flag (1 WU) that pertain to the whole transaction.

Every **input** must indicate the UXTO it's spending per an outpoint (txid+vout = 32+4 B), have a sequence value (4 B), and have an input script (`scriptSig`). For non-segwit output types, the `scriptSig` contains _script arguments_ and/or a _redeemscript_ to satisfy the _output script_ (`scriptPubKey`). For wrapped segwit inputs, the `scriptSig` consists of a _redeemscript_ that contains a _witness program_ which redirects to the _Witness Stack_ as the _final script_. For native segwit outputs, the `scriptSig` is empty which is indicated by a scriptSig length of 0. Per the segwit rules this is interpreted as a validation redirection to the `Witness Stack`. Note that if a transaction has at least one segwit input, there must be a _Witness Stack_ for every input, with non-segwit inputs having a length-zero _Witness Stack_ (i.e. just one byte to indicate the length of 0).

**Outputs** consist of an amount of satoshis (8 B) and an output script (`scriptPubKey`). Outputs don't have witness data.

### P2PKH

TxHeader: `10 B = 40 WU`  
Input¹: `148 B = 592 WU`  
Output: `34 B = 136 WU`  

For legacy formats, the raw size, stripped size and virtual size are all equal because they do not have witness data.

Tx with 2 inputs and 2 outputs:  
`raw = stripped = vsize = 10 B + 2×148 B + 2×34 B = 374 B = 374 vB`  
`weight = 4×374 vB = 1496 WU`

### P2SH-P2WPKH

TxHeader: `10 B + 2 WU = 10.5 vB = 42 WU`  
Input²: `64 B + 108 WU = 91 vB = 364 WU`  
Output: `32 vB = 128 WU`  

Tx with 2 inputs and 2 outputs:  
raw = `12 B + 2×(64 B + 108 B) + 2×32 B = 420 B`  
stripped = 1`0 B + 2×64 B + 2+32 B = 202 B`  
weight = `42 WU + 2×(4×64 vB + 108 WU) + 2×128 WU = 1026 WU = 256.5 vB`

### P2WPKH

TxHeader: `10 B + 2 WU = 10.5 vB = 42 WU`  
Input³: `41 vB + 108 WU = 68 vB = 272 WU`  
Output: `31 vB = 124 WU`  

Tx with 2 inputs and 2 outputs:  
raw = `12 B + 2×(41 B + 108 B) + 2×31 B = 372 B`  
stripped = `10 B + 2×41 B + 2×31 B = 154 B`  
weight = `42 WU + 2×(4×41 vB + 108 WU) + 2×124 WU = 834 WU = 208.5 vB`

### P2TR

TxHeader: `10 B + 2 WU = 10.5 vB = 42 WU`  
Input⁴: `41 vB + 66 WU = 57.5 vB = 230 WU`  
Output: `43 vB = 172 WU`  

Tx with 2 inputs and 2 outputs:  
raw = `12 B + 2×(41 B + 66 B) + 2×43 B = 312 B`  
stripped = `10 B + 2×41 B + 2×43 B = 178 B`  
weight = `42 WU + 2×(4×41 vB + 66 WU) + 2×178 WU = 846 WU = 211.5 vB`
